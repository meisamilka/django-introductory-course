# Introductory Django Course




This repository contains the source code and educational materials for the **Introductory Django course**. To use the source code, you must have **Python** and **pip** installed on your system. It is highly recommended to use a Virtual Environment for each project. I have used **Cursor & Vscode** for development, but you are free to use any other code editor like PyCharm.




Each topic is organized into its own dedicated folder, and each session is numbered within its respective topic folder.
